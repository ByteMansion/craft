# Solutions to Leetcode problems

## Preface

**Stay hungry, Stay foolish.**

Time elapses, knowledge emerges.
As a software engineer, it is important to keep yourself curious about new tech and embrace new concepts that ever emerge. 

Actions speak louder than words. I believe, and then I do.

I am a freshman, and still know little about the whole computer science field. Keep forward and work hard.

"Zwei Dinge erfuellen das Gemuet mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je oefter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschaeftigt: der bestirnte Himmel ueber mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir." 

("Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the moral law within.") 

This is my favourite sentence written by Immanuel Kant. I modified the last two phrases:
> **Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the unknown science fields and the simple and clear logics.**

## Intro

This repo is about some solutions to Leetcode problems. Leetcode, a well-known website for all IT engineers, is platform to enhance our technical skills using some real interview questions.

I confess, honeatly and earnestly, not all solutions are posted by myself. 
Some problems are easy and obvious, some problems need specific knowledge or tricks which I have never heard before.
In order to solve those medium or hard problems, I referred to the `Discussions` and `Solutions` pages. 
I didn't list all reference links, but really appreciate their kindness and selflessness.

## Folders
In **explorer** folder, I classify all solutions by problem tags, such as array, tree, string, etc.
In some cases, I provide a couple of solutions to a problem, that may be different in time/space complexity or method theory.
To make file readable and easy-searched, I add a problem index before each solution.

In **doc** folder, I listed some important algorithms used in some solutions, including algorithm introduction, code demos, basic proofs and similar problems. 
These algorithms come from wikipedia, blogs or technical manuals. I document and integrate those references into a file to make it more informative. 
Anything wrong, please feel free to let me know.

# Prereqisite and Build
Your system should install gcc compiler and support **c++ 11** standard.
Execute `make` command and if succeed, an executable named **solution** will be created.
- `make`: compile this project
- `make clean`: clean .o, .core and core files
