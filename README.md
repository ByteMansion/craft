# Solutions to Leetcode problems

## Preface

In order to sharpened my head, I will update this repo when I am not busy.
As as as I am concerned, as a software engineer, it is important to improve yourself constantly. 
Actions speak louder than words. I believe, and then I do.

I am still, and always, a freshman, and still know little about the whole computer science. I will learn more and work harder.

"Zwei Dinge erfuellen das Gemuet mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je oefter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschaeftigt: der bestirnte Himmel ueber mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir."("Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the moral law within.") This is my favourite sentence written by Immanuel Kant. I modified the last two phrases and that is what I want to say:

> **Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the unknown science fields and the simple and clear logics.**

## Brief Introduction

This repo is about the solutions to Leetcode problems, a well-known website for all IT engineers.
I have to say, honeatly and earnestly, that not all solution are solved on my own. Sometimes, some problems need specific knowledge or tricks which I have never heard, and then I refered problem discussions, methods provided by others and so on. I donot list all of them, but I am really appreciate their kindness and selflessness.

In **explorer** folder, I sometimes provide not just one solution to a problem. These solutions may vary from time/space complexity to original thoughts, some of which are my contribution, some are others(I have to thank those solution contributors again). 
In order to cataloge all problems clearly, I create several files according to the problem tags on website and then provide solutions by problems indice.

In **doc** folder, I list some important algorithms, in which I will give some introductions, code demos, applications and most important, related problems. These algorithms are not my inspirations or inventions, and I just collect them from wikipedia, blogs or books, and then file a document by my understanding. If anything wrong, please feel free to let me know.
