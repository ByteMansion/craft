# Solutions to Leetcode problems

## Preface

**Stay hungry, Stay foolish.**
As as as I am concerned, as a software engineer, it is important to keep yourself
 curious about new tech and embrace new concepts that ever emerge. 

Actions speak louder than words. I believe, and then I do.

I am still, and always, a freshman, and still know little about the whole computer
 science. I will learn more and work harder.

"Zwei Dinge erfuellen das Gemuet mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und 
 Ehrfurcht, je oefter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschaeftigt: der 
 bestirnte Himmel ueber mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir." 

("Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer
 and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the moral law within.") 

This is my favourite sentence written by Immanuel Kant. I modified the last two phrases:
> **Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more 
>  earnestly I reflect on them: the unknown science fields and the simple and clear logics.**

## Intro

This repo is about the solutions to Leetcode problems, which is a well-known website for all IT engineers.

I have to say, honeatly and earnestly, that not all solutions are solved on my own. 
Sometimes, some problems need specific knowledge or tricks which I have never heard before.
In order to solve them, I refered to the problem discussions and methods posted by others and so on. I didn't
 list all reference links, but I am really appreciate their kindness and selflessness.

## Folders
In **explorer** folder, I cataloge solutions by problem tags and  provide my solutions to those problems.
Sometimes I provide not just one solution to a problem, that  may vary from time/space complexity to original thoughts.
In each file, I add a comment before problem solution and denote its index.

In **doc** folder, I list some important algorithms used in some solutions, including algorithm introduction, code demos, 
 basic proofs and the most important, related problems. These algorithms are not my inspirations or inventions, but  collecting
 from wikipedia, blogs or books. I document and integrate those reference into a file by my understanding. 
If anything is wrong, please feel free to let me know.

# Prereqisite and Build
Your system should install gcc compiler and support **c++ 11** standard.
Execute `make` command and if succeed, an executable named **solution** will be created.
- `make`: compile this project
- `make clean`: clean .o, .core and core files
